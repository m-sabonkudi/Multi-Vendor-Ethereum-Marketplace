## About

Pyman is a product-focused marketplace built for buying and selling vehicles with Ethereum-powered escrow. It hides blockchain complexity behind a modern storefront, letting users browse vehicles, make purchases with their wallet, and rely on smart contracts to hold funds until the sale is complete.

---

## Why Pyman?

- **Trust:** Payments go into a smart contract escrow until buyers confirm delivery.
- **Simple UX:** A marketplace feel â€” browse brands, filter vehicles, save favorites â€” with wallet integration.
- **Fairness:** Built-in dispute and refund flows protect both buyers and sellers.

---

## Key Features

- Browse vehicles by brand, mileage, newest listings, and more.
- Wishlist / favorites and a clear product page for every vehicle.
- On-chain escrow: funds are locked in a smart contract during the transaction.
- Clear on-chain transaction states: _initiated â†’ delivered â†’ confirmed â†’ claimed_ (or _disputed_).
- Dispute system and return/refund flow.
- Vendor dashboard to manage listings and claims.

## How It Works (user flow)

A friendly breakdown of what happens when a buyer and vendor transact:

1. **Make a Purchase**

   - Buyer clicks _Buy_ on a vehicle and signs a transaction.
   - The marketplace calls the smart contract to create a transaction record `transaction(productPrice, seller)`, sets the transaction status as `Status.Pending` and returns a `txn_id`.
   - Funds (ETH) are placed into escrow by the contract.

2. **Vendor Delivers Product**

   - When the vendor ships/delivers the vehicle, they call `deliver(txn_id)`.
   - Contract updates the transaction status to `Status.Delivered` and emits a `Delivered` event.

3. **Buyer Confirms Delivery**

   - After receiving the vehicle, the buyer calls `satisfy(txn_id)` (confirm).
   - Contract updates the transaction status to `Status.Delivered`, emits `TransactionConfirmed` and the transaction moves toward settlement.

4. **Vendor Claims Funds**

   - Vendor calls `claim(txn_id)` to withdraw the escrowed ETH once the transaction is confirmed.
     - If 24 hrs **have not** passed since the transaction was confirmed, then `revert WaitPeriodHasNotPassed`
     - Else if 24 hrs **have** passed since the transaction was confirmed;
       - If the transaction status is `Status.Confirmed`;
         - Contract updates the transaction status to `Status.Delivered`, sends ETH to vendor and emits `SellerClaimed`.
       - Else revert transaction_status

5. **If Buyer Disputes**

   - If an issue appears (e.g., mismatch, damage) the buyer can call `dispute(txn_id)`.
     - If 24 hrs **have** passed since the transaction was confirmed, then `revert WaitPeriodHasPassed`
     - Else if 24 hrs **have not** passed since the transaction was confirmed;
       - Contract sets status to `Status.Disputed` and emits `BuyerDisputed`. This prevents the vendor from claiming the funds (currently in escrow).

6. **Return / Refund**
   - If the vendor confirms the product return, the vendor calls `sellerConfirm(txn_id)` to confirm seller side and trigger refund.
   - Contract returns ETH to buyer and emits `SellerConfirmed`.

This flow keeps both parties protected and auditable on-chain.

## Getting Started (for users)

These steps are written for shoppers who want to use the Pyman marketplace.

### 1. Prepare your wallet

- Install the MetaMask web3 wallet.
- Connect your wallet to the correct network (the app should indicate if itâ€™s a testnet or mainnet).

### 2. Browse and choose

- Browse vehicles by brand, mileage, or newest listings.
- Save favorites to your wishlist.

### 3. Buy with confidence

- Click **Buy**, approve the transaction in your wallet. The smart contract will hold funds in escrow.
- Wait for the vendor to deliver to you.

### 4. Confirm or dispute

- When you receive the vehicle, confirm delivery of the order.
  - If thereâ€™s an issue, dispute the transaction **within 24 hrs** after confirming delivery â€” this will pause the vendorâ€™s ability to claim funds and trigger dispute resolution steps.

---

## For Vendors

- Create accurate listings with photos, mileage, and clear descriptions.
- When ready to deliver, call the `deliver` flow in the app to mark the item as shipped/delivered.
- After the buyer confirms delivery, wait for 24 hrs, (if the buyer didn't dispute) you will then be claim your funds using the `claim` flow.
- If the buyer disputed, wait to get product return, then use the `sellerConfirm` step to process refunds as needed.

## Final notes

Pyman aims to make vehicle buying and selling as simple as browsing a site â€” while adding the safety of blockchain escrow. If you want, I can:

- Turn this into a developer README with contract ABI, tests, and local setup commands;
- Polish the screenshots and add a demo GIF;
- Generate a short marketing blurb for the repo description.
